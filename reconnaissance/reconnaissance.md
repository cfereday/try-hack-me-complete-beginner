# Reconnaissance

Finding out information, rather than actively enumerating (e.g. scanning a site).

Enumeration
- passive
- active

# Domains
`apt install sublist3r
sublist3r -d irobot.com
crt.sh
`

### Example regex
`%irobot.com`

### Details
- Info on subdirectories - internal & external
- Intercept requests using burpsuite for example
- Response headers giving away what the server is
- Credential stuffing / password spraying
-  get emails > spraying accounts (without locking users out)
